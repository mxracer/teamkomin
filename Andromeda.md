## What is Andromeda? ##
Andromeda is Georgio Armani's private build. When Georgio Armani asked Samsung for a phone. The result was the GT-i9010 Armani. Then, when AT&T and Rogers asked Samsung to build a phone, the same hardware was given to them and called SGH-i897. The difference is that AT&T and Rogers added alot of bloatware to their packages. Andromeda is, in essence, a pure Captivate without advertisements, bloatware, and services which cost you money. Andromeda is maintained by Team Komin.
